# jackson-bot
 A Discord Bot built in NodeJS to highlight the many quirks of my dear friend Jackson
 
 The initial scope of this project includes the following commands:
	> Jackson-isms: Return a random quip and phrase often said by Jackson
	> Song Request: Returns songs liked by Jackson through Spotify
	> Picture: Returns a random image of Jackson
	> Montage: Returns a random montage from Jackson's YouTube channel
	> Workout of the Day: Returns a workout that is generated daily
	> Inspirational Quotes: Returns a quote from a famous author, musician, activist, etc. that Jackson follows
	> Overwatch?: Randomly pings a user in the Discord server asking to play Overwatch
